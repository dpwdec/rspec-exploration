# RSpec Exploration

This project contains learning projects that I undertook to improve my understand of RSpec

1. `factorial.rb` and `factorial_spec.rb` test for creating a program that outputs the factorial of a number passed to it.
2. `lib/namer.rb` and `spec/namer_spec.rb` explore doing set up in the rspec loop.
